# The-Eye
"The Eye", a service that will collect those events from these applications, to help your org making better data-driven decisions.

By the entities apresentation it supouse that there is an external aplication named `Application` who communicate with our application (`The-Eye`). Also we can see that there is a model that need to be store it's information this model is `Event`.

Some Event data are fixed but other can change according to which event an Application is sending that the case of `data` field inside the event data request.

***

**Note**

I had some problems with docker, it's saving the `log` information but isn't saving the `event` data .
